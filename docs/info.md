## How it works

The ADC compares the input signal to a generated Vdd/2 signal. If input is larger, the new comparison signal will be 3/4*Vdd or othewise 1/4*Vdd. etc. This is done in 8 steps, so 8 bits adc

## How to test
Analogue in, is converted, and the output needs to be the same analogue value
